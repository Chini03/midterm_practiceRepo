    <p> Android vs Apple, the two biggest mobile operating systems; 
        one can see obvious sides of both Android and Apple. 
        Android is without the developer restrictions or the sole-device 
        type no other mobile open-source operating system can touch. 
        On the other hand, iOS boasts of being a minimalistic functioning 
        system with a streamline of excellent designs and consistent software 
        updates for its range of devices that it uniquely controls. 
        Regardless of the strengths and weaknesses of these two platforms, 
        you may well end up getting an Android or Apple device simply because 
        most people tend to go for what they feel most comfortable with.

        <h2>Why Apple is better</h2>
        <h3> iOS is generally faster and smoother</h3>
        <img src="images/Apple_faster.jpeg" width="500" height="300"
         alt="Apple_faster">
        <p>What makes Apple unique is that it designs exclusive and high-performance microprocessors, 
            which are exclusive to its devices. Building its chips helps Apple deliver 
            industry-leading performance in an iPhone in terms of speed and accuracy. 
            Together with these processors being powerful, there bigger dimensions means 
            extra hardware, which improves the overall performance of the phone, 
            can also be added.
            Relatively more CPU cores and a bigger performance cache end power 
            efficient iPhones, which in turn make their peers all look good but die young long. 
            You can also make use of the CleanUp app for further improving the speed of your phone. 
            Unlike most of the companies that design and manufacture chips for other manufacturers, 
            Apple strategically focuses its processors on iPhones.

        <h3> iOS is simple to use</h3>

        <p> Their ease of use is as a result of a simple layout: 
            all applications are located on the home page, and all settings are in one place. 
            There is no learning curve when you change a version of an IPhone since the layout 
            of the operating system does not change.
            It have good updates frecuently and Apple thinks how to do the life of the user 
            easier. 
        </p>
         <h3>The Apple ecosystem</h3>

         alt="Apple_family">
         <p>Apple builds its products is such that everything operates flawlessly within the 
            ecosystem of Apple coupled with its users being able to use many devices in a 
            very effortless manner. For instance, one can start typing a document on the 
            MacBook and later want to edit it on the iPad or the iPhone without a break. 
            Global level of this way of coordination between the hardware and the software 
            increases the output of work as there is much less time wasted in changing the platforms 
            and logging on to the relevant accounts. The blemishes are eliminated through the use of Apple's
             iCloud service as users have the ability to keep documents, pictures and data online for easy 
             access through any Apple device. As an example, when a user creates a project on a macbook 
             computer and saves it to the cloud, that user can later access the project on their iPad or 
             iPhone without manually transferring files. In this way, they ensure that they are always 
             working on the most recent version of their work and do not have to waste time or be 
             inconvenienced by the devices that they are using
